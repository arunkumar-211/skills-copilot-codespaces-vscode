---------------------------------------
1. Write a query to fetch the names of employees and their department name.
	

2. Find the total hours logged by each employee across all projects.
3. Retrieve the department name and count of employees in each department.
4. Identify employees who work on more than 2 projects.
5. Write a query to find employees who do not work on any project.


-- --------------- SOLUTION ----------------- 
-- 1. Query to fetch the names of employees and their department name
Select employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.department_name from employees
inner join departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
 
-- 2.  Total hours logged by each employee across all projects
select * from Employees;
Select employees.first_name, employees.last_name, Employee_Projects.hours_logged from employees
inner join Employee_Projects on employees.employee_id = Employee_Projects.employee_id;
 
-- 3. Department name and count of employees in each department
Select d.department_name, count(e.department_id) as emplyoee_count
from departments d
left join employees e on e.department_id = d.department_id
group by d.department_id, d.department_name;
 
-- 4. Identify employees who work on more than 2 projects
Select p.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name from employee_projects p
left join employees e on e.employee_id = p.employee_id
group by employee_id
having count(project_id) > 2;
 
-- 5.  query to find employees who do not work on any project
Select employee_id, first_name, last_name from employees
where employee_id NOT IN (Select employee_id from employee_projects);
-- alternative approach
SELECT a.employee_id, a.first_name, a.last_name from employees a
left join employee_projects b on a.employee_id = b.employee_id
where b.employee_id is null;
